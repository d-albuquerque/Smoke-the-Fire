This is a public version of a private repository. Only little information can be found here.

This is a project completed in 2017, to find out more contact me.

## Introduction

The â€œSmoke the Fire" project was created with the aim of protecting the biological health of our forests and assisting firefighters in fighting fires, thus promoting the protection of habitats, human and animal lives, with a design of a fire detection device smoke to be placed on top of trees and electricity poles.

This device aims to issue a quick alert to the authorities indicating a possible fire, allowing greater efficiency in the performance of the authorities before it.

When the smoke reaches the sensor, the processor of the device commands the GSM module in order to send a written message to the firefighters, with information on the exact moment of the fire detection and the location coordinates.

In addition there is an RF antenna for the devices to communicate with each other creating a network of sensors.
