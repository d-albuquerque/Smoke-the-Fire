# Smoke the Fire

This repository includes the files of the PCB, of the electronic scheme, the C code of the microcontroller, the server code, the website files and some 3D files.


## Introduction

The â€œSmoke the Fire" project was created with the aim of protecting the biological health of our forests and assisting firefighters in fighting fires, thus promoting the protection of habitats, human and animal lives, with a design of a fire detection device smoke to be placed on top of trees and electricity poles.

This device aims to issue a quick alert to the authorities indicating a possible fire, allowing greater efficiency in the performance of the authorities before it.

When the smoke reaches the sensor, the processor of the device commands the GSM module in order to send a written message to the firefighters, with information on the exact moment of the fire detection and the location coordinates.

In addition there is an RF antenna for the devices to communicate with each other creating a network of sensors.

## Website and server

Here you can see what the site was like, there is a server that communicates with the site to show on a site the devices that have detected a fire.

There is a promoter video in Portuguese: https://youtu.be/lm4-HQ3rrdI

This is a project completed in 2017, to find out more contact me.
Note that this repository is not complete. (for example, the 3D files of the battery and PCB supports are missing)
